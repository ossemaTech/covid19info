                            COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in
                            humans. It was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, where it has 
                            caused a large and ongoing outbreak. It has since spread more widely in China. 
                            Cases have since been identified in several other countries. The COVID-19 virus is
                            closely related to a bat coronavirus.

                            Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the
                            genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two
                            bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat 
                            coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
