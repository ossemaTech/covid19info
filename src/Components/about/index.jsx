                    In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started monitoring 
                    the outbreak of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the respiratory illness 
                    now known as COVID-19. Authorities first identified the virus in Wuhan, China.
                    More than 78,191 people have contracted the virus in China. Health authorities have
                    identified many other people with COVID-19 around the world, including in the United
                    States. On January 31, 2020, the virus passed from one person to another in the U.S.
